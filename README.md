## Description

Better Battery is a creative way to use GitHub for tracking a batteries remaining charge

## Inspiration

One of GitHub's main uses is tracking any changes made in code repositories.

The theme of tracking changes has inspired me to think outside the box and come up with a creative way to use GitHub.

One question I asked myself is _What things do I care to track changes over time?_
As I used my phone to try and conjure up ideas, I noticed my battery was about to die.

Then it hit me, **Batteries!**

## What it does

Better Battery utilizes GitHub to track the change in battery capacity over time so that anyone can better their understanding of battery utilization!

## How it was built built

Better Battery was built by using a number of different technologies:

- An Arduino board for taking input of battery voltage

- GitHub for tracking the changes of a batteries power

- Python for communication with the host computer and the Arduino

- Bash for automation of commits and pushes to GitHub

## Challenges we ran into

- Communication with the host computer and the Arduino

- Automation of commits and pushes to GitHub

## What we learned

- Reading in a battery's voltage using an Arduino

- Automation of commits and pushes to GitHub using Bash

- Communication between the host computer and the Arduino

## What's next for Better Battery

Some possible next steps for Better Battery are:

- Improved UI for user's to visualize their battery's changes in capacity

- Implement a wider range of batteries to test

- Faster testing platform

## Things to improve on give more time

If I were allotted more time I would have figured out the optimal Python library that would allow communication between the host computer and the Arduino board.

Since I have almost finished the project I have every intention to ensure that **Better Battery** is up and running.
